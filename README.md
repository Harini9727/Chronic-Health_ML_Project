Behavioral Drivers of Preventative and Chronic Health: A Multivariate Approach

This analysis was conducted to better understand risk behaviors that can influence aspects of physical well-being. The study looks at the following: how chronic illness impacts quality of life, diabetes risk factor relationships, how physical activity and other similar factors impact individual health, what behaviors women exhibit around preventative health, and whether principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce dimensionality by creating smaller subsets that explain most of the variability in the original dataset. 

The results were processed using a variety of methods in addition to the PCA mentioned before: canonical component analysis (CCA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), multiple regression, and hierarchical cluster analysis (HAC). This study was conducted using data collected via cellular or landline telephone from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The results revealed that chronic illness can negatively impact quality of life, there are three main risk factors contributing to the incidence of diabetes, chronic illnesses and lifestyle factors impact an individual's general health, and women fall into four main cluster groupings of behaviors around preventative health measures. In conclusion, it was determined that many different risk factors influence various aspects of a personâ€™s health. It is important to conduct these kinds of studies to better educate the general population on actions they can take to prevent avoidable illness and disease.
